this project has been inspired by:

http://pleasantsoftware.com/developer/3d/spherebot/

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

HOW TO:

1.) Upload the Arduino sketch.

	(I have added an additional multiplicator to the y-Step calculation to 
	match my spherebot to the unicorn-script coordinates. You will maybe have to
	do the same adjustment for your Spherebot)

	(You will also have to redefine your pins accordingly to your electronics design)

2.) Start the Spherebot-UI.exe and connect to your Arduino

Warning for custom Firmwares: 	The send file function will only work if the arduino answers
								each sent command with a message that contains "ok:" so that 
								the next command is sent.
				
				
Additional Notes:

	The communication is based on the qextserialport library. I tried to make it 
	event-based but I wasnÂ´t able to get the event that a new line is received 
	firing. So I simply made the communication not event but polling-based. If 
	someone smarter than me could make it eventbased, it would be awesome :D. 
	It works polling based pretty good,	I would just be curious to know how 
	to do it for future projects. 
	

PS:Have fun with it ;)
